# cypher-gen

This cypher generator is based off 
[this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/txjloq/a_difficult_riddle_to_give_your_players_as/),
and is intended to be a simple Dungeon Master tool for some D&D puzzles.



`cypher-gen <string>` will output a number cypher based on `<string>` input

(example: `Hello, World!` output: `8.5.12.12.15.23.15.18.12.4`)

## TODO
[ ] `-p --pangram <string>` use custom pangram as source (default `a-z`)
